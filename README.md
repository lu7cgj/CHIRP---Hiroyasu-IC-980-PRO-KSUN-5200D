# CHIRP---Hiroyasu-IC-980-PRO-KSUN-5200D
This project provides a complete toolset for working with the Hiroyasu IC-980Pro codeplug format (.YSF). The official CPS software is extremely limited, slow, and difficult to edit, so I developed a set of Python scripts that allow full extraction, editing, cleaning, and re-encoding of all channel data using simple CSV files.

1. YSF → CSV Decoder

Converts any .YSF file generated by the Hiroyasu CPS into a clean, editable CSV.
All channel fields—including RX/TX frequencies, tone settings, DCS/CTCSS values, bandwidth, power, scan settings, and scrambling options—are extracted and placed into a human-readable table. This allows easy editing in Excel, LibreOffice, Notepad, or any spreadsheet tool.
The decoder also normalizes corrupt or unused channel entries and can optionally remove empty rows automatically.

2. CSV → YSF Encoder

Rebuilds a fully valid Hiroyasu .YSF file from the edited CSV.
The encoder preserves the original header and footer structure of the radio’s format and inserts channels into their correct binary positions.
This enables you to modify hundreds of channels in seconds that would otherwise require hours inside the CPS.
You only need Python installed—no dependencies, no external libraries.

3. CHIRP CSV → Hiroyasu CSV Converter (CHIRP → YSF bridge)

This is the most requested feature and the primary reason this project exists. CHIRP does not support Hiroyasu radios, and no native compatibility exists. However, using this script you can take any CSV exported from CHIRP (tested with Baofeng UV-5R, UV-82, and similar models) and automatically convert it into a Hiroyasu-compatible CSV with all fields mapped to the correct YSF structure.

To make the workflow even easier, I also included an empty Baofeng UV-5R IMG file in this repository.
This IMG acts as a universal template for users who don’t own a UV-5R:

Open CHIRP → Load the UV-5R IMG

Import any CSV from another radio (as long as it was exported from CHIRP)

Export the CSV again under the UV-5R format

CHIRP always exports UV-5R channel tables in a stable, predictable layout, making them fully compatible with this converter. That means you can standardize any radio’s CHIRP CSV into the UV-5R format before converting it to Hiroyasu.

Once converted, simply feed the file into encoder.py to generate a fully functional .YSF codeplug ready for upload to the IC-980Pro.

This toolkit enables, for the first time, a clean CHIRP → Hiroyasu workflow, allowing batch edits, cross-radio presets, and large codeplug maintenance with minimal effort. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
