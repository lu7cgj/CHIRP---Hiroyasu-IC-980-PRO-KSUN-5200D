# CHIRP---Hiroyasu-IC-980-PRO-KSUN-5200D
This project provides a complete toolset for working with the Hiroyasu IC-980Pro codeplug format (.YSF). The official CPS software is extremely limited, slow, and difficult to edit, so I developed a set of Python scripts that allow full extraction, editing, cleaning, and re-encoding of all channel data using simple CSV files.

1. YSF → CSV Decoder

Converts any .YSF file generated by the Hiroyasu CPS into a clean, editable CSV.
All channel fields—including RX/TX frequencies, tone settings, DCS/CTCSS values, bandwidth, power, scan settings, and scrambling options—are extracted and placed into a human-readable table. This allows easy editing in Excel, LibreOffice, Notepad, or any spreadsheet tool.
The decoder also normalizes corrupt or unused channel entries and can optionally remove empty rows automatically.

2. CSV → YSF Encoder

Rebuilds a fully valid Hiroyasu .YSF file from the edited CSV.
The encoder preserves the original header and footer structure of the radio’s format and inserts channels into their correct binary positions.
This enables you to modify hundreds of channels in seconds that would otherwise require hours inside the CPS.
You only need Python installed—no dependencies, no external libraries.

3. CHIRP CSV → Hiroyasu CSV Converter (CHIRP → YSF bridge)

This is the most requested feature and the primary reason this project exists. CHIRP does not support Hiroyasu radios, and no native compatibility exists. However, using these scripts you can take any CSV exported from CHIRP and automatically convert it into a Hiroyasu-compatible CSV with all fields correctly mapped to the YSF structure.

To make the workflow even easier, I include two empty CHIRP image files in this repository:

1. Empty Baofeng UV-5R IMG (standard template)

This IMG acts as a universal template for users who don’t own a UV-5R:

Open CHIRP → Load the UV-5R IMG

Import any CSV from another radio (as long as it was exported from CHIRP)

Export the CSV again under the UV-5R format

CHIRP always exports UV-5R channel tables in a stable, predictable format, which makes them fully compatible with the converter script chirp_to_hiroyasu_csv(uv5r-uv82).py.
This allows you to standardize any radio’s CHIRP CSV into the UV-5R layout before converting it to Hiroyasu.

2. Empty Baofeng UV-17R IMG (supports the 1.25 m band)

For radios that include the 220 MHz / 1.25 m band, I also provide an empty UV-17R IMG.
This template ensures that CHIRP retains all 1.25 m channels when importing and exporting CSV files—something the UV-5R cannot do due to hardware limitations.

Use this template with the script chirp_to_hiroyasu_csv(uv17r).py, which is specifically designed to interpret the UV-17R channel structure, including correct tone handling, bandwidth, and special cross-mode behavior.
